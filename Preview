#We view a SKU as a set of attribute levels, apply maximum
likelihood estimation to sales history of the SKUs currently carried by the retailer to estimate
the demand for attribute levels and substitution probabilities, and from this, the demand for any
potential SKU, including those not currently carried by the retailer. We specify several alternative
heuristics for choosing SKUs. We apply this approach to optimize assortments for three real examples:
snack cakes, tires and automotive appearance chemicals. A portion of our recommendations
for tires and appearance chemicals were implemented and produced sales increases of 5.8% and 3.6%
respectively, which are significant improvements relative to typical retailer annual comparable store
revenue increases. We also forecast sales shares of 1, 11 and 25 new SKUs, for the snack cakes,
tires and automotive appearance chemicals applications, respectively with MAPEs of 16.2%, 19.1%
and 28.7%.
